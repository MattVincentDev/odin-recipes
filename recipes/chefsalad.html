      Get ready to make this simple, easy, delicious Chef's Salad!
    </h2>

    <div p>
      If simple and no time is your goal, this is the recipe for you. It doesn't
      get any better than chunks of sharp <strong>Cheddar</strong>, lots of
      <strong>lettuce</strong> , mouth watering <strong>dressing</strong>, with
      some tasty <strong>cucumber</strong>, and some juicy
      <strong>chicken!</strong>
    </p>
    <div p>
      This is a classic dish with the perfect ratio of your
      <em>ingredients.</em>
      The black pepper is not oppresive as it's balanced out in the tangy
      buttermilk and creamy mayo.
      <strong>You cant go wrong!</strong>
    </p>

    <h2 class="titles2">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="lists">
      <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts halves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh dill</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon grated or minced garlic</li>
      <li>5 ounces butter lettuce, torn</li>
      <li>3 cups chopped iceberg lettuce</li>
      <li>1 cup thinly sliced English cucumber</li>
      <li>4 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>1 pint cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
      <li>1 medium avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
      <li>2 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and quartered</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="titles2">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="lists">
      <li>
        Preheat a gas grill to medium heat (400 to 450 degrees F, or 200 to 230
        degrees C) or a grill pan over medium-high heat; oil the grates. Pat
        chicken dry and sprinkle evenly with 3/4 teaspoon salt.
      </li>

      <li>
        Place chicken on the preheated grill and cook, turning occasionally,
        until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board
        and let rest for 10 minutes before chopping.
      </li>

      <li>
        While chicken rests, stir together buttermilk, mayonnaise, sour cream,
        chives, parsley, dill, black pepper, garlic, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon
        of the salt in a medium bowl.
      </li>

      <li>
        Toss butter lettuce and iceberg in a large bowl or platter. Arrange
        chicken, cucumber, cheese, tomatoes, avocado, and eggs over lettuce.
        Drizzle 1/2 of the dressing. Serve with remaining dressing on the side.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="titles2">Cook's Notes</h2>
    <div p>
      Eggs, chicken, and dressing can be prepared up to 3 days in advance. With
      those done, this comes together rather quickly.
